###What are we doing in this project?
This project is to use data visualization (pretty graphs!) and lots of number crunching to improve on the energy consumption of the most energy consuming buildings on the Boston University Charles River campus. 

###What information do we have to work with? 
We use factors such as weather, room and building characteristics, and class schedules against detailed electricity data. So information like data on the electricity usage for each building all the way from 2010 in 15 minute increments, and class 
schedules of every single class, including summer classes, are up for analysis. This is all stored on a MySQL database for fast and convient storage. 

###What technologies are being used?
The graphs and regression analysis is currently coded in R, which requests information from the MySQL database in most functions.
